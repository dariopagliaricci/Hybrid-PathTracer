Hybrid-PathTracer - macOS (Apple Silicon) Build Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------

This is a personal fork of the original [GLSL-PathTracer](https://github.com/knightcrawler25/GLSL-PathTracer),
adapted and optimized by Dario Pagliaricci for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) with GLSL 410 and OpenGL 4.1 compatibility.

Dependencies
------------
Install required libraries using Homebrew:

    brew install cmake sdl2 openimagedenoise

Build Instructions
------------------

1. Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/dariopagliaricci/Hybrid-PathTracer.git
    cd Hybrid-PathTracer

2. Create and enter the build directory:

    mkdir build
    cd build

3. Run CMake to configure the project:

    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

4. Build the project:

    make -j

5. Run the path tracer:

    ./PathTracer

Additional Notes
----------------

- This fork uses `gl3wApple` as the OpenGL loader instead of glad.
- All shaders have been upgraded to `#version 410 core` for OpenGL 4.1 on macOS.
- The code is compatible with macOS Ventura and newer, running on Apple Silicon hardware.
- If you encounter macOS driver warnings (e.g., about `GLD_TEXTURE_INDEX_2D_ARRAY`), they're handled internally.

Samples and Assets
------------------

The original project provided sample GLTF and OBJ scenes via Google Drive:

Place the `assets/` folder in the root directory alongside the executable, or adjust paths accordingly.
